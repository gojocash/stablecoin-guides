# 1. Choosing a stablecoin and exchange

When choosing a stablecoin to use for transfers, it is important to consider the following factors:

1. What crypto exchanges are supported in the countries of the sender and the receiver?
2. What coins and blockchains are supported by these exchanges?
3. What are the transfer fees?
4. Are the tokends reputable?



## 1. What crypto exchanges are supported in the countries of the sender and the receiver?

You will need to convert your fiat money to stablecoins using crypto exchange, like Coinbase, Binance, or WazriX.

Each coin exchange supports only a set of specific countries, where it can connect to your banking account to transfer money in and our a crypto wallet.

You will need to find an exchange that is available in your country. Then you can find a good set of the coin and blockchain for your transfer needs.

Here's a list of crypto exchanges that we know of:
| Exchange   | Country | Supported stablecoins | Supported blockchains |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Coinbase   | USA     | USDT, USDC            | Ethereum              |
| Binance.US | USA     | USDT, USDC, BUSD      | Ethereum, BSC         |
| Bitso      | Mexico  | USDC, USDT, BUSD      | Ethereum              |
| WazirX     | India   | BUSD, USDC            | Ethereum              |
| CoinDCX    | India   |                       | Ethereum              |


## 2. What coins and blockchains are supported by these exchanges?

Stablecoins can exist of mutiple blockchains. For example, USDT supports Algorand, Avalanche, Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Near, Omni, Polygon, Solana, Bitcoin Cash's Standard Ledger Protocol, Statemine, Statemint, Tezos, and Tron.

However, most crypto exchanges support only a set of blockchains. For example, Coinbased supports USDT but only on the main Ethereum blockchain, not any other options.

You will need to use coin plus blockchain combination that exists in both countries:
- The country of the sender
- The country of the receiver

Most blockchains are good enough for simple money transfers. I usually use Aglorand, Solana, or BSC.

:::note Example
Here's a practical example for planning a stablecoin money transfer.
- The sender is in the US and uses Coinbase
- The receiver is in India and uses WazirX

The only two stablecoins supported by both platforms are BUSD and USDT on Ethereum network.

This is common that Ethereum is the only blockchain supported by most of the exchanges.

## 3. What are the transfer fees?



## 4. Are the tokends reputable?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that are backed by a real company that hold a collateral, real market funds and securities that could be used to exchange the stablecoins back to fiat money.

As of today, I recommend to use the most common stablecoins that disclose collateral assets with high level of transparency:
1. USDC backed by Circle
2. USDT backed by Tether
3. BUSD backed by Binance
