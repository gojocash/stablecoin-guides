# About

## What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset or fiat currency, such as the US dollar. The value of a stablecoin is designed to remain stable, unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which can experience significant price fluctuations. Stablecoins are often used as a means of storing value or as a unit of exchange, similar to traditional fiat currencies.

There are several different types of stablecoins, including those that are collateralized, algorithmic, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Collateralized stablecoins are backed by a physical asset, such as gold or real estate, while algorithmic stablecoins are designed to maintain their value through a set of predetermined rules. CBDCs are issued and backed by central banks, and are similar to traditional fiat currencies in that they can be used for transactions and as a store of value.

Overall, stablecoins offer a way for individuals and businesses to transact using a digital currency that is more stable in value compared to other cryptocurrencies. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a means of storing value, a unit of exchange, and as a tool for conducting financial transactions.

## Benefits of using stablecoins

There are several benefits to using stablecoins for money transfers.

### 1. Lower fees

One of the main advantages is the potential for lower fees compared to traditional financial services. Because stablecoins are based on blockchain technology, they can be transferred and settled more efficiently, potentially leading to lower costs for users. This can be particularly useful for individuals and businesses sending money internationally, as traditional money transfer services can often be expensive.

### 2. Faster transaction times

Another benefit of using stablecoins for money transfers is the potential for faster transaction times. Because stablecoins are digital and based on blockchain technology, they can be transferred and settled almost instantly. This can be especially useful for individuals and businesses that need to send money quickly, as traditional financial services can often take several days to complete a transfer.

### 3. Security

Additionally, because stablecoins are based on blockchain technology, they can potentially be more secure than traditional financial services, as transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger that is resistant to tampering.

## Downsides of using stablecoins

There are a few potential downsides to using stablecoins.

### 1. Regulatory uncertainty

One issue is the potential for regulatory uncertainty, as the use of stablecoins is still a relatively new and rapidly evolving area. In some jurisdictions, there may be unclear or conflicting regulations regarding the use of stablecoins, which could potentially create risks for users.

:::note
For money transfers, the regulatory uncertainty is not very dangerous since most users will stores stablecoins only during the tranfers and convert them to the fiat currencly shortly after receiving.

### 2. Risk of instability

Another potential downside is the risk of instability in the value of the asset or fiat currency that a stablecoin is pegged to. If the value of the underlying asset or currency decreases significantly, the value of the stablecoin could also decline. This could potentially create losses for users who are holding stablecoins as a store of value.

### 3. High conversion fees

One potential downside of using stablecoins could be high conversion fees when exchanging them for other currencies or assets. This could potentially make stablecoins less practical or cost-effective for certain types of transactions. For example, if the fees for converting stablecoins to fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies are significantly higher than traditional financial services, it may not be a cost-effective option for individuals or businesses looking to make large or frequent transactions.
